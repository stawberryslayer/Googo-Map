## Development Conventions
- Create a branch from `main` to work on the development of feature.
- Once ready to be merged to main, make a pull request and request review from one teammate.
- Wait for review/approval before merging to main. This practice helps catch potential issues early and ensures code quality.

- Do NOT directly commit any code to the main branch.

- Commit Messages: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain whether you are **developing** certain feature or you are **fixing** some issues and what have you changed.
